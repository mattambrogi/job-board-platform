# job-board-platform

This is a web application that allows anyone to create their own job board. You can think of it as a Shopify for job boards.

As a host, I can
- Create a job board which I can share
- Add job listing to my board
- View a host dashboard. In my dashboard, I can: accept or deny posts which have been submitted to my board, edit, delete, or add posts. I can also view analytics on how often my board or an individual post has been viewed.

As a user looking for jobs, I can
- View a job board that is shared with me and browse the postings within that board

As a employers, I can
- Submit jobs to job board
- View an employer dashboard in which I can: see all my job postings and whether their status (accepted or not), I can see how many views my listings have gotten.
